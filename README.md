# deepEIci

**一个100%为自己，而非为其他任何人做嫁衣的项目**

Predict EIciRNAs using LSTM and CNN, followed by quantification through realignment.

I embarked on this project upon realizing that identifying EIciRNAs solely from RNA-seq data is challenging and incomplete, in which the quantification can be relatively inaccurate, sometimes resulting in few or no detected EIciRNAs in the worst-case scenarios.

To ensure advancements in the EIciRNA field and to develop robust methodologies that can withstand scrutiny, I committed to completing this demanding task.
